# AI newsletter idea

I want to create a newsletter that scrapes the following topic and categorizes them in different sections:

- Top storylines / breaking news: AI announcements, model releases
- Research spotlight: breakthroughs, papers worth reading, primer summaries
- Startup radar: hot or up‑and‑coming AI startups including fundraising, traction
- Tech drama: social media drama between tech folks/companies, layoffs, open‑source community conflicts, IPO buzz
- Upcoming events: upcoming tech events and conferences happening all over the world
- Influencers: interviewers (if they have a podcast/video content like [fireshio.io](http://fireshio.io) or want to scrape that and summarize the main points into a easily digestible summary), what vibe coders are up to
- Top products of the week (latest product launches, libraries, products to be on the lookput for, vibecoding tools, models worth playing with)
- Opinion / Editorial Cover: dont want to implement this section until there is enough traffic for the newsletter

There might be other topics as well so please feel to add additional topics or group similarly related topics. I want this to be a monetized newsletter (freemium model) and want it to be the one stop go for all ai related news and a buy me a coffee support. I want to have a clean mobile version too. And right now i want to have a niche of vibecoders/developers and those in the tech/ai industry. I also want a poll section and some sort of interactivity. I want my newsletter to be attractive and stand out from the other existing newsletters. Maybe can use web crawlers/ai agents/ llms to make this happen?
