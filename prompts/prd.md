### **3. Phase 1 (MVP) Features & Requirements**

The MVP is focused on delivering a high-quality, free weekly newsletter covering the most critical text-based content categories.

#### **3.1. Automated Content Sourcing Engine**
The system shall autonomously discover and ingest content from a predefined set of high-value sources.

*   **FR 1.1 - News & Blog Scraping:**
    *   The system shall scrape articles from a curated list of AI news sites, tech blogs, and startup announcements (e.g., TechCrunch, company engineering blogs).
    *   **Technical Note:** Implementation will use a robust Python-based scraping framework (e.g., BeautifulSoup/Requests enhanced with a service like ZenRows) to handle dynamic content and basic anti-bot measures. The system *must* be designed to respect `robots.txt` and adhere to website Terms of Service as a foundational principle (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 7.2).
*   **FR 1.2 - Research Paper Ingestion:**
    *   The system shall ingest metadata and abstracts for new research papers from the arXiv e-print archive.
    *   **Technical Note:** This shall be implemented via the official arXiv API to ensure reliability and avoid the complexities of scraping the website directly (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 2.2). Direct API usage is preferred over scraping wherever available.

#### **3.2. AI Content Processing & Curation Pipeline**
The system shall process raw ingested data into structured, summarized, and categorized content ready for the newsletter.

*   **FR 2.1 - Text Summarization:**
    *   The system shall generate concise, accurate, and coherent summaries for all ingested articles and research papers.
    *   **Technical Note:** This will be powered by a primary high-quality LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude). A "MapReduce" strategy must be implemented to handle documents that exceed the LLM's context window by chunking, summarizing chunks, and then summarizing the summaries (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 3.1, 3.2). Prompt engineering will be a core focus to ensure a consistent, high-quality tone suitable for our audience.
*   **FR 2.2 - Content Categorization:**
    *   The system shall automatically categorize each piece of content into the predefined MVP sections:
        *   `Top Storylines / Breaking News`
        *   `Research Spotlight`
        *   `Startup Radar`
        *   `Top Products of the Week`
    *   **Technical Note:** This will be achieved via LLM-based classification using carefully engineered prompts.
*   **FR 2.3 - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Foundation:**
    *   The system shall use a RAG architecture to ground the AI's generation process in the specific content it is summarizing.
    *   **Technical Note:** All ingested content must be processed, chunked, and stored as embeddings in a vector database (e.g., Weaviate, LlamaIndex). When generating summaries or categorizations, the system will first retrieve the most relevant content chunks to provide context to the LLM. This is critical for improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and optimizing token costs (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 3.3).

#### **3.3. Newsletter Generation & Delivery**
The system shall assemble the curated content into a polished newsletter and deliver it to subscribers.

*   **FR 3.1 - Newsletter Platform Integration:**
    *   The curated content from the AI pipeline shall be programmatically sent to a third-party newsletter platform for assembly and delivery.
    *   **Technical Note:** We will integrate with **Beehiiv** due to its strong API support, built-in monetization features for Phase 2, and analytics capabilities (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 5.1).
*   **FR 3.2 - Mobile-First Design Template:**
    *   A custom newsletter template shall be designed and implemented on the chosen platform.
    *   **Requirement:** The design must be mobile-first, clean, and visually differentiated, reflecting a "vibecoder" aesthetic (e.g., muted palettes, simple data visualizations, excellent typography). All design choices must be rigorously tested on mobile clients (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 5.3, 5.4).
*   **FR 3.3 - Web Archive:**
    *   All sent newsletters must be publicly available via a web archive to support SEO and discoverability. The chosen platform (Beehiiv) provides this natively.

### **4. Phase 2 Features & Requirements**

Once the MVP has validated the core product, we will expand its capabilities and introduce monetization.

*   **FR 4.1 - Expanded Content Sourcing:**
    *   **Podcasts:** Integrate a service like Castmagic or Snipcast.io to transcribe and summarize key AI-related podcasts for the "Influencers" section (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 2.3).
    *   **Social Media:** Develop a sophisticated filtering system to monitor platforms like X (Twitter) and Hacker News for "Tech Drama" and trending topics. This must be approached with extreme caution regarding APIs, ToS, and signal-to-noise ratio.
*   **FR 4.2 - Freemium Monetization:**
    *   **Gated Content:** Implement a freemium model where certain deep-dive summaries, special reports, or entire content sections are available only to paid subscribers (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 6.1).
    *   **Subscription Management:** Integrate Stripe via the newsletter platform (Beehiiv) to handle recurring subscription payments seamlessly (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 6.2).
*   **FR 4.3 - Interactive Elements:**
    *   **Polls:** Introduce a simple, one-question poll in each newsletter to boost engagement.
    *   **Technical Note:** This must be implemented using HTML embedding with a "graceful degradation" strategy, providing a link-based fallback for email clients with limited support (e.g., Outlook) to ensure a consistent experience for all users (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 5.2).
*   **FR 4.4 - AI Agent Orchestration:**
    *   Evolve the content pipeline into a more autonomous system using an AI agent framework like **LangChain** or **AutoGen**.
    *   **Technical Note:** Agents will be tasked with orchestrating the entire workflow, from discovering a new article to summarizing, categorizing, and queueing it for the newsletter, allowing for more complex, multi-step reasoning (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 3.3).

---

### **5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

*   **NFR 1 - Scalability:** The backend architecture must be designed for scalability. We will adopt a **hybrid cloud-native approach**, using serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) for event-driven, intermittent tasks like scraping and summarization, and microservices for persistent components like the orchestration layer (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 4.1).
*   **NFR 2 - Cost-Effectiveness:** LLM inference is a primary cost driver. The system must incorporate **aggressive cost optimization techniques**, including KV caching for frequent requests, batching, a multi-LLM routing strategy (using cheaper models for simpler tasks), and prompt engineering focused on minimizing token usage (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 4.3).
*   **NFR 3 - Reliability & Fault Tolerance:** The content pipeline must be robust. This includes implementing exponential backoff for API rate limits, request queues for scraping jobs, and comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all pipeline stages (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 4.4).
*   **NFR 4 - Legal & Ethical Compliance:** This is non-negotiable.
    *   The scraping engine **must** programmatically check and adhere to `robots.txt` directives.
    *   The data processing pipeline **must** include a step to detect and filter/redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to comply with GDPR/CCPA (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 7.2).
    *   A "human-in-the-loop" review process must be in place for final newsletter content to mitigate risks of copyright infringement and ensure quality, recognizing that purely AI-generated content may not be copyrightable (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 7.1).
*   **NFR 5 - Maintainability:** Code must be modular and well-documented. Prompts used for LLMs must be version-controlled as first-class citizens of the codebase (Ref: Tech Spike Sec 3.4).

### **6. Out of Scope for MVP (Phase 1)**

*   Paid subscriptions and gated content.
*   Podcast, video, and social media content sourcing.
*   Interactive polls and surveys.
*   The "Upcoming Events" and "Tech Drama" sections (due to sourcing complexity).
*   The "Opinion / Editorial Cover" section.
*   "Buy Me a Coffee" integration (can be added easily later, but focus is on core product).
